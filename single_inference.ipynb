    "    Question: 古典音樂最突出的特徵是時什麼\n",
    "\n",
    "    Passage A: 古典音樂是指根植於西方音樂傳統的藝術音樂，包含了從大約11世紀直至當代的廣大時間範圍。\n",
    "                這一藝術傳統的中堅時期通常被劃定為從1550年到1900年的這段時間，又稱共曉時期。\n",
    "                西方音樂記譜法除了為演奏者預設了一段音樂的音高、速度、拍子、節奏，其特別之處在於對細節的處理也進行了描述，例如即興裝飾音與力度變化，\n",
    "                然而這些即興裝飾音通常是為了尚未精通即興演奏藝術的初學者而寫的，另一方面，力度變化在很多情況下沒有標示，需要仰賴演奏者對音樂的內在了解去做詮釋。\n",
    "                與其他樂種一樣，古典音樂在器樂方面有相當高度的發展，這與以歌曲為主的流行音樂形頗為不同。\n",
    "                「古典音樂」一詞最早見於19早期初期，最初是用於凸顯從巴赫到貝多芬的這一段黃金時期。\n",
    "                牛津英語詞典中「古典音樂」一詞最早出現在1836年。\n",
    "\n",
    "    Passage B: 由於古典音樂包含了極其眾多的形式、風格、流派和歷史時期，因此很難列舉出適用於全部古典音樂作品的普適特徵。\n",
    "                然而，仍然可以找到一些其他音樂類型所不具備的，只有古典音樂所獨有的特徵。\n",
    "                古典音樂最突出的特徵就是作品通常是以記譜法表記，形成一份樂譜。\n",
    "                樂譜的突出作用是確定節奏、音高的細節，以及在涉及多名表演者時不同聲部間的協調。\n",
    "                優質的表記方法不僅使得作品得以留存，更使得作品能夠達到相當複雜的程度，但複雜的內容也沒有必要完全受限於譜。\n",
    "                例如巴赫的賦格，驚為天人地將大膽鮮明的多條旋律線條以對位法編制在一起，同時又不失密切關聯的和聲邏輯，卻也有即興演出的即興賦格。\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Passage C: 古典音樂中使用的多數樂器都是在19世紀中葉之前發明，在18、19世紀納入樂隊編制的。\n",
    "                他們包括管弦樂團和管樂團中的各類樂器，還包括一些獨奏樂器，如鋼琴，大鍵琴和管風琴。\n",
    "                交響管弦樂團是最為人熟知的古典音樂媒介，它包含了弦樂器組，木管樂器組，銅管樂器組和打擊樂器組。\n",
    "                管樂團是另一類演奏古典音樂的團體，它包含了木管樂器組，銅管樂器組和打擊樂器組。\n",
    "                與以歌曲為主的眾多流行音樂形式不同，古典音樂為人熟知的乃是它發展出的高度複雜的器樂形式，包括協奏曲，交響曲，奏鳴曲，組曲，練習曲，交響詩，歌劇等。\n",
    "                古典音樂的作曲者多半渴望用其情感及智力的內涵，以及之間複雜的關係，將這些層面放在其音樂中。\n",
    "                其中許多傑出的作品會在不同的段落中，將動機或是音樂觀念，以不同形式一再的重覆過程。\n",
