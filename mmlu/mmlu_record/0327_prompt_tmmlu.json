Explain your answer.\n(A) 平均數是23, (B) 四分位距是23, (C) 中位數是23, (D) 眾數是23\nSolution:\nThe mean, median, mode, and interquartile range of the ages of the nine people are all 20. This means that the ages of the people are all the same, and the mean, median, and mode are all equal to 20.\n\nIf the ages of the people are all the same, then the mean, median, and mode will all be the same after 3 years. The mean will be 20 + 3 = 23, the median will be 20 + 3 = 23, and the mode will be 20 + 3 = 23.\n\nThe interquartile range is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. Since the ages of the people are all the same, the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile will also be the same, and the interquartile range will be 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 向上移動6單位, (B) 向下移動3單位, (C) 向下移動6單位, (D) 向上移動3單位\nSolution:\nThe function $y=2(x-175)(x-176)+6$ is a parabola that opens upward. The vertex of the parabola is at $(175.5, -0.5)$. To make the parabola intersect the $x$-axis at two points that are 1 unit apart, we need to move the parabola up or down so that the vertex is at $(175.5, 0.5)$.\n\nIf we move the parabola up by 3 units, the vertex will be at $(175.5, 3.5)$, which is not the desired point.\n\nIf we move the parabola down by 3 units, the vertex will be at $(175.5, -3.5)$, which is the desired point.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B).

Therefore, the maximum value of $a^2+b^2$ occurs when $b=10/3$ and $a=10-10/3=20/3$. Substituting these values into the expression $a^2+b^2$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{400}{9}+\\frac{100}{9}\\\\\n&=\\frac{500}{9}\\\\\n&\\approx55.56.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the maximum value of $a^2+b^2$ is approximately 55.56.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 30 元, (B) 16 元, (C) 27 元, (D) 48 元\nSolution:\nLet $x$ be the price of each notebook. Then, the number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is $\\frac{36}{x}$. Since the number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is an integer, $x$ must be a factor of 36. The factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Since the price of each notebook is more than 10 dollars, the price of each notebook is 12, 18, or 36 dollars.\n\nIf the price of each notebook is 12 dollars, then the number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is $\\frac{36}{12}=3$. If the price of each notebook is 18 dollars, then the number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is $\\frac{36}{18}=2$. If the price of each notebook is 36 dollars, then the number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is $\\frac{36}{36}=1$.\n\nTherefore, the number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe number of notebooks that can be bought for 36 dollars is 1, 2, or 3.",

The line $L$ intersects the parabola $y=-2x^2+b$ at $C$ and $D$.\n\nWe have that $AB=2$, so $A$ and $B$ are the points $(-1,-2)$ and $(1,-2)$. Therefore, $3(-1)^2+a=-2$ and $3(1)^2+a=-2$, which gives $a=-5$.\n\nWe have that $CD=4$, so $C$ and $D$ are the points $(-2,-2)$ and $(2,-2)$.

If $y=0$, then $x=4-0=4$. If $y=4$, then $x=4-4=0$.\n\nSince $x-y$ is a linear function, it must be a straight line. Therefore, the value of $x-y$ is the same for all points on the line.

Explain your answer.\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\n(D)\n\nSolution:\n\nThe graph of $f(x)=x^2-2x-3$ is a parabola. To find the vertex, we can use the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=1$ and $b=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\\frac{-2}{2(1)}=1$. Substituting $x=1$ into the equation, we get $f(1)=1^2-2(1)-3=-4$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(1,-4)$.\n\nThe $y$-intercept of the parabola is the value of $f(x)$ when $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation, we get $f(0)=0^2-2(0)-3=-3$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of the parabola is $(-3,0)$.\n\nThe $x$-intercepts of the parabola are the values of $x$ when $f(x)=0$. Setting $f(x)=0$ and solving for $x$, we get $x^2-2x-3=0$. Factoring the left side, we get $(x-3)(x+1)=0$. Therefore, the $x$-intercepts of the parabola are $(3,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.\n\nUsing the information we have found, we can plot the graph of the function $f(x)=x^2-2x-3$. The graph should have a vertex at $(1,-4)$, a $y$-intercept at $(-3,0)$, and $x$-intercepts at $(3,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.",

If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two real roots, and the graph of the quadratic function will intersect the $x$-axis at two points.\n\nFor the function $y=-x^2+2x-5$, the discriminant is $2^2-4(-1)(-5)=4-20=-16<0$. Therefore, the graph of the function will not intersect the $x$-axis at two points.\n\nFor the function $y=4x^2+24$, the discriminant is $0^2-4(4)(24)=-384<0$. Therefore, the graph of the function will not intersect the $x$-axis at two points.\n\nFor the function $y=-2x^2-8x-11$, the discriminant is $(-8)^2-4(-2)(-11)=64-88=-24<0$. Therefore, the graph of the function will not intersect the $x$-axis at two points.\n\nFor the function $y=3x^2-6x+1$, the discriminant is $(-6)^2-4(3)(1)=36-12=24>0$. Therefore, the graph of the function will intersect the $x$-axis at two points.\n\nTherefore, the function $y=3x^2-6x+1$ is the only one that has two real roots, and its graph will intersect the $x$-axis at two points.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (D).

If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.

Therefore, $a-b$ is to the left of $0$ on the number line.\n\nThe distance from $A$ to $B$ is $b-a$. The distance from $C$ to $D$ is $a-b$. Since $b-a=-(a-b)$, the distance from $A$ to $B$ is the same as the distance from $C$ to $D$.\n\nThe distance from $A$ to $C$ is $a+b-a=b$. The distance from $B$ to $D$ is $a-b+b=a$.

This is a quadratic function, and its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{1}{2a}$. Since $a$ is positive, $x$ is positive, so the vertex is to the right of the $y$-axis. Therefore, the maximum value of $a b$ occurs when $a=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (A).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 9, (B) 18, (C) 12, (D) 6\nSolution:\nLet $x$ be the number of people who left the school, and $y$ be the number of people who joined the school. Then, we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n1016 - x + y &= 1028 - 3x + 3y \\\\\n2x - 2y &= 12 \\\\\nx - y &= 6 \\\\\nx &= y + 6.\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1016 - (y + 6) + y &= 1028 - 3(y + 6) + 3y \\\\\n1010 - y &= 1028 - 3y \\\\\n2y &= 18 \\\\\ny &= 9.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the number of people who joined the school is 9, and the number of people who left the school is 15. The number of people in the school after the change is 1028 - 15 + 9 = 1012. The number of people in the school before the change is 1016. Therefore, the number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016. The number of people in the school after the change is 1012, and the number of people in the school before the change is 1016.

This gives us the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n7^2a+7b&=14^2a+14b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 49a+7b&=196a+14b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 147a&=7b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 21a&=b.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $y=ax^2+21ax=ax(x+21)$. The maximum value of $y$ occurs when $x=\\frac{-21+21}{2}=0$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ occurs at $x=0$, which is the time when the height is the highest.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (A).

The greatest common divisor of a and b is the product of the common prime factors of a and b, each raised to the minimum of their exponents. Since 52 × 32 × 5 has no common prime factors, the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B).

The AM-GM inequality states that for any two positive numbers $x$ and $y$, the arithmetic mean of $x$ and $y$ is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of $x$ and $y$. In other words,\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{2}\\ge\\sqrt{xy}.$$\n\nIn this case, we have $x=a$ and $y=b$, so the arithmetic mean of $a$ and $b$ is $\\frac{a+b}{2}=\\frac{100}{2}=50$. The geometric mean of $a$ and $b$ is $\\sqrt{ab}$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\\frac{100}{2}\\ge\\sqrt{ab}\\Rightarrow50\\ge\\sqrt{ab}.$$\n\nTo find the maximum possible value of $a\\cdot b$, we want to find the smallest possible value of $\\sqrt{ab}$.

The roots of this function are $x = -6 \\pm \\sqrt{5 + k}$, so $c = -6 - \\sqrt{5 + k}$ and $d = -6 + \\sqrt{5 + k}$.\n\nWe can see that $a + b = -12$ and $c + d = -12$, so $(a + b) = (c + d)$.\n\nWe can also see that $b - a = 2\\sqrt{5}$ and $d - c = 2\\sqrt{5 + k}$, so $(b - a) > (d - c)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (A).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 10, (B) 12, (C) 14, (D) 16\nSolution:\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of $a + b$. Since $a^2 + b^2 = 100$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 10^2$. This means that the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ is 10.\n\nThe only right triangle with integer sides and a hypotenuse of 10 is the 6-8-10 triangle. This means that $a = 6$ and $b = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a + b$ is $6 + 8 = \\boxed{14}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (C).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 501 ~ 750元, (B) 1 ~ 250元, (C) 751 ~ 1000元, (D) 251 ~ 500元\nSolution:\nLet $x$ be the number of each type of bread sold. Then the total revenue is $15x+25x+35x=75x$. Since the revenue is the same for each type of bread, we have $15x=25x=35x$. This implies that $x=0$, which is not possible. Therefore, the revenue must be positive.\n\nIf the revenue is less than 250, then $75x<250$, which implies that $x<3\\frac{1}{3}$. Since $x$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 1. Therefore, the revenue is at least $75\\cdot1=75$ and less than 250.\n\nIf the revenue is between 251 and 500, then $251<75x<500$, which implies that $3\\frac{1}{3}<x<6\\frac{2}{3}$. Since $x$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 4. Therefore, the revenue is at least $75\\cdot4=300$ and less than 500.\n\nIf the revenue is between 501 and 750, then $501<75x<750$, which implies that $6\\frac{2}{3}<x<10$. Since $x$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 7. Therefore, the revenue is at least $75\\cdot7=525$ and less than 750.\n\nIf the revenue is greater than 750, then $75x>750$, which implies that $x>10$. Since $x$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 11. Therefore, the revenue is at least $75\\cdot11=825$ and greater than 750.\n\nTherefore, the revenue is between 501 and 750.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (C).

This means that $x$ and $y$ are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse 10.\n\nThe only possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem are 6 and 8, or 8 and 6. Therefore, the value of $x+y$ is either 14 or 14.\n"

Explain your answer.\n(A) 二個條件一起加入才足夠新聞發佈用, (B) 只加入條件 2 就足夠, (C) 只加入條件 1 就足夠, (D) 二個條件一起加入仍不足夠\nSolution:\nIf we add the two conditions together, we get that the total number of votes is $13+19+40-1=71$. If we assume that the total number of votes is 71, then the number of votes for the other two candidates is $40-13-19=18$. Since 18 is less than 40, it is possible for the other two candidates to tie for the most votes and for the other two candidates to be elected as the class president. Therefore, the two conditions together are not enough to determine that \"小武不會當選班長\".\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (D).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 2, (B) 4, (C) 6, (D) 8\nSolution:\nWe can square both sides of the equation $x+y=4$ to get $x^2+2xy+y^2=16$. Since $x^2+y^2=16$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $16+2xy=16$. Solving for $xy$ gives $xy=0$.\nNow, we can use the fact that $x^2+y^2=16$ and $xy=0$ to find the value of $x-y$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-y)^2&=x^2-2xy+y^2\\\\\n&=(x^2+y^2)-2xy\\\\\n&=16-0\\\\\n&=16.\n\\end{align*}\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $x-y=\\pm4$. Since $x+y=4$, we know that $x$ and $y$ are both positive, so $x-y$ must be positive. Therefore, $x-y=4$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B). I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $x$ and $y$ are real numbers such that $x^2+y^2=16$ and $x+y=4,$ what is the value of $x-y?$\nWhat of the following is the right choice?

If $f(a)=1$, what is the value of $a$?\nWhat of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.\n(A) 0, (B) 1, (C) 2, (D) 3\nSolution:\nWe have that $f(a)=a^2+2a+1=1$. Solving for $a$, we get $a^2+2a=0$, which factors as $a(a+2)=0$. Therefore, $a=0$ or $a=-2$.

Explain your answer.\n(A) -12, (B) 12, (C) -3, (D) 3\nSolution:\nWe can use the method of \"trial and error\" to find the values of a, b, and c. We know that 39x2 + 5x −14 = ( 3x + a )( bx + c ) = 3bx2 + ( 3c + ab )x + ac. Comparing the coefficients of x2, we have 3b = 39, so b = 13. Comparing the coefficients of x, we have 3c + ab = 5, so 3c + 13a = 5. Since a and c are integers, we can try different values of a to find a value of c that satisfies the equation. For example, if a = 1, then 3c + 13 = 5, so c = -4. Therefore, a + 2c = 1 + 2(-4) = -7.\n\nIf we try a = -2, then 3c - 26 = 5, so c = 11. Therefore, a + 2c = -2 + 2(11) = 20.\n\nIf we try a = 3, then 3c + 39 = 5, so c = -12. Therefore, a + 2c = 3 + 2(-12) = -15.\n\nIf we try a = -4, then 3c - 52 = 5, so c = 19. Therefore, a + 2c = -4 + 2(19) = 34.\n\nIf we try a = 5, then 3c + 65 = 5, so c = -20. Therefore, a + 2c = 5 + 2(-20) = -35.\n\nIf we try a = -6, then 3c - 78 = 5, so c = 27. Therefore, a + 2c = -6 + 2(27) = 48.\n\nIf we try a = 7, then 3c + 91 = 5, so c = -30. Therefore, a + 2c = 7 + 2(-30) = -53.\n\nIf we try a = -8, then 3c - 104 = 5, so c = 37. Therefore, a + 2c = -8 + 2(37) = 66.\n\nIf we try a = 9, then 3c + 117 = 5, so c = -38. Therefore, a + 2c = 9 + 2(-38) = -67.\n\nIf we try a = -10, then 3c - 130 = 5, so c = 45. Therefore, a + 2c = -10 + 2(45) = 70.\n\nIf we try a = 11, then 3c + 143 = 5, so c = -48. Therefore, a + 2c"

The least common multiple of $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$ is 360.\n\nWe can write $n_1=6a$, $n_2=15b$, and $n_3=10c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Then, the least common multiple of $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$ is $30abc$.\n\nSince $30abc=360$, we have $abc=12$.\n\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, we have $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=12$ or $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=6$ or $a=1$, $b=3$, and $c=4$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{6}{6}$, $\\frac{15}{15}$, and $\\frac{10}{120}$ or $\\frac{6}{6}$, $\\frac{15}{30}$, and $\\frac{10}{60}$ or $\\frac{6}{6}$, $\\frac{15}{45}$, and $\\frac{10}{30}$.\n\nThe three fractions are $\\frac{1}{1}$, $\\frac{1}{1}$, and $\\frac{1}{12}$ or $\\frac{1}{1}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{6}$ or $\\frac{1}{1}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the three fractions are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the",

Therefore, $100+10a+b$ is a multiple of $12$.\n\nIf $100+10a+b$ is a multiple of $12$, then $10a+b$ must be a multiple of $12$.\n\nSince $10a+b$ is a multiple of $12$, $10a+b$ must be a multiple of $3$ and $4$.\n\nSince $10a+b$ is a multiple of $3$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $3$.\n\nSince $10a+b$ is a multiple of $4$, $b$ must be a multiple of $4$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $3$ and $b$ is a multiple of $4$, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$ and $b$ must be a multiple of $4$.\n\nSince $a$ is a multiple of $3$ and $b$ is a multiple of $4$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $12$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $12$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $3$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $36$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $36$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $4$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $144$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $144$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $3$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $432$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $432$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $4$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $1728$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $1728$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $3$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $5184$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $5184$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $4$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $20736$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $20736$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $3$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $62208$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $62208$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $4$, $a+b$ must be a multiple of $248832$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of $248832$ and $a+b$ is a multiple of $3$,",

Explain your answer.\n(A) 12, (B) 20, (C) 16, (D) 15\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.

Explain your answer.\n(A) 8, (B) 14, (C) 2, (D) 5\nSolution:\nThe number is 100+10a+b.\nThe number is divisible by 12, so it is divisible by 3 and 4.\nThe number is divisible by 3, so 1+a+b is divisible by 3.\nThe number is divisible by 4, so the last two digits are divisible by 4.\nThe last two digits are 10a+b, so 10a+b is divisible by 4.\nThe possible values of a+b are 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 70, 74, 78, 82, 86, 90, 94, 98.\nThe only possible value of a+b is 14.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B).

Explain your answer.\n(A) 2500, (B) 5000, (C) 10000, (D) 20000\nSolution:\nWe have that $a+b=100$, so $a\\cdot b=(a+b)^2-a^2-b^2=100^2-a^2-b^2$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we have that $a^2$ and $b^2$ are positive integers, so $a^2+b^2\\ge2ab$.\nTherefore, $100^2-a^2-b^2\\le100^2-2ab$.\nWe want to maximize $a\\cdot b$, so we want to minimize $2ab$.\nThe minimum value of $2ab$ is $100^2$, which occurs when $a=b=50$.\nTherefore, the maximum value of $a\\cdot b$ is $100^2-50^2=5000$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (B).

Let's call the points $A$ (the school), $B$ (the library), $C$ (the post office), and $D$ (the train station).\n\nFrom the descriptions of the landmarks, we can find the coordinates of the points:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= (0,0)\\\\\nB &= (0,500)\\\\\nC &= (300,200)\\\\\nD &= (200,0)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can use the coordinates of the points to find the distance between them. For example, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\\sqrt{(0-0)^2+(500-0)^2} = 500$ units.\n\nWe can also use the coordinates to find the direction of the paths. For example, the direction of the path from $A$ to $B$ is $\\frac{500-0}{0-0} = \\infty$, which means that the path is vertical.\n\nNow, we can use the coordinates of the points to find the path from the library to the train station. The path is a straight line from $B$ to $D$, so it has the equation $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. The slope of the line is $\\frac{0-500}{200-0} = -\\frac{5}{2}$, and the $y$-intercept is $0$. So the equation of the line is $y = -\\frac{5}{2}x$.\n\nTo find the point where the line intersects the $x$-axis, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= -\\frac{5}{2}x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the point where the line intersects the $x$-axis is $(0,0)$, which is the school. So the path from the library to the train station is a straight line from the library to the school, which is a straight line from the library to the post office, which is a straight line from the post office to the school.\n\nThe path from the library to the post office is a straight line from the library to the school, which is a straight line from the library to the post office, which is a straight line from the post office to the school.\n\nThe path from the post office to the school is a straight line from the post office to the school, which is a straight line from the post office to the train station, which is a straight line from the train station to the school.\n\nThe path from the train station to the school is a straight line from the train station to the school, which is a straight line from the train station to the post office, which is a straight line from the post office to the school.\n\nThe path from the post office to the school is a straight line from the post office to the school, which is a straight line from the post office to the train station, which is a straight"

Explain your answer.\n(A) 4, (B) 6, (C) 8, (D) 10\nSolution:\nLet the length of the shorter piece be $x$ feet. Then the length of the longer piece is $x+2$ feet. Since the total length of the rope is 10 feet, we have\n\n$$x+(x+2)=10.$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get\n\n$$2x+2=10\\Rightarrow2x=8\\Rightarrow x=4.$$\n\nTherefore, the length of the shorter piece is 4 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (A). I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\n\nA 10-foot-long rope is cut into two pieces. The length of one piece is 2 feet longer than the length of the other piece.
